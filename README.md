# gradle-credential-wrapper
##Purpose 
Generate a custom gradle wrapper that applies the gradle-credentials-plugin via an init script so credentials can be used 
in a build's build script closure, among others.

##Notes
This project was partially inspired by the example at 
[Gradle Goodness: Distribute Custom Gradle in Our Company][1].
